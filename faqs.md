## How can I get my 0x relayer listed on 0x Tracker?

## How can I get my token listed on 0x Tracker?

Token information is automatically sourced from [Ethplorer](https://ethplorer.io) which means you do not need to submit tokens directly to 0x Tracker. If you notice that information is missing for a particular token please follow these steps:

* Check whether the token information is available on Ethplorer using their search.
* If the token information is on Ethplorer then please [file a bug](https://github.com/0xTracker/0x-tracker-worker/issues/new) on the 0x Tracker GitHub.
* If the token information is missing from Ethplorer please fill out their [contact form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfJ8m5n1HDw28-WCrATm8wriEutJDUq8KAVrLwO2WNeKrwFGA/viewform).

## How can I trust the information being reported?

All of the code behind 0x Tracker is open source and available to inspect on [GitHub](https://github.com/0xTracker). This helps to provide an end-to-end understanding of how data is collected, processed and served.

Unfortunately it is not currently possible to provide proof that this code is actually being used in production. If you want to verify that the data being served on 0xtracker.com is not being tampered with in some way then you're welcome to run the projects yourself. By running the project you can reproduce the data set for comparison against 0x Tracker.
