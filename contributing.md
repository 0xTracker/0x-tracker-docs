# Contributing

0x Tracker has been open source since late 2018 and welcomes contributions from anyone. Even if you are not a developer there are still plenty of ways to contribute. Contributions are generally categorised into one of three things: issues, content, and code.

## Reporting bugs and feature requests

The simplest way to contribute is by reporting bugs that you may have noticed or requesting features you are interested in seeing built.

0x Tracker uses a popular open source platform called GitHub for managing issues. If you are a non-developer then the best place to submit issues will be in the [client project](https://github.com/0xTracker/0x-tracker-client/issues). If you are a developer and are reporting a project specific issue then please post it on the relevant project.

Be sure to check whether your issue has not already been raised by someone else. If the issue has already been raised then feel free to signal your interest through [reactions](https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) or contribute additional thoughts in the comments.

### Documentation

All of the documentation you find on [docs.0xtracker.com](https://docs.0xtracker.com) is editable via the [docs repository](https://github.com/0xtracker/0x-tracker-docs) on GitHub. If you notice a mistake or feel that something is missing then please feel free to submit a pull request to the repository with your changes.

## Contributing code

All of the code for 0x Tracker is open source and can be found on GitHub, making it easy to  contribute changes. The platform is comprised of a few different projects: 0x Event Extractor, 0x Tracker Worker, 0x Tracker API, and 0x Tracker Client.

Heading over to the [GitHub organisation](https://github.com/0xtracker) will allow you to dig into the codebase of each project. Javascript is used across the entire stack, making it easy for anyone familiar with the NodeJS ecosystem to contribute across the entire suite of projects.

If you are keen to contribute but do not know where to start then be sure to check out the existing issues in each repository. You can also get a better understanding of current initiatives by looking at the [organisation's projects](https://github.com/orgs/0xTracker/projects).
