# Token Metadata

Token information is automatically sourced from [Ethplorer](https://ethplorer.io) and token contracts which means you do not need to submit tokens directly to 0x Tracker. If you notice that information is missing for a particular token please follow these steps:

* Check whether the token contract exposes decimals, name, and symbol values.
* Check whether the token information is available on Ethplorer using their search.
* If the token information is available in the token contract or on Ethplorer then please [file a bug](https://github.com/0xTracker/0x-tracker-worker/issues/new) on the 0x Tracker GitHub.
* If the token information is missing from Ethplorer please fill out their [contact form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfJ8m5n1HDw28-WCrATm8wriEutJDUq8KAVrLwO2WNeKrwFGA/viewform).
