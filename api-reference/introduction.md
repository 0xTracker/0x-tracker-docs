# Introduction

The 0x Tracker public API is provided free of charge for use by other projects in the 0x, Ethereum and wider cryptocurrency ecosystems. All of the data displayed on 0xtracker.com is available through a variety of different endpoints.

The API endpoints are exposed via a single read-only base URL:

```text
https://api.0xtracker.com
```

All requests to the API will receive [JSON](https://www.json.org/) encoded responses and conventional HTTP response codes. No API keys or authentication is necessary when making requests.

## Attribution

The 0x Tracker API is free to use without restriction however we ask that you provide attribution with a link/reference back to 0xtracker.com if your use of the data is made public \(e.g. infographics, web UIs, PDF reports\). Something as simple as "xyz data provided by [0x Tracker](https://0xtracker.com)" or "Source: 0xtracker.com" will do.

## Projects using the API
